; Dummy zero dihedral types for those which are missing in CHARMM
; Note: in some residue topologies in CHARMM, especially in the CGenFF part (e.g. C3, BUTY) some dihedrals have no
; corresponding interaction parameters based on the types of the participating atoms (e.g. C1-C2-C3-C4 in BUTY).
; CHARMM simply ignores these dihedrals, giving you messages like 
; "CHECKDH> dihedral :    1    3    4    7 will NOT be generated". Grompp however gives you an error.
; As a workaround, this file contains [ dihedraltypes ] with zero force constant for these dihedral types.

; When looking for improper dihedral parameters, GROMACS does an A-B-C-D -> D-C-B-A reversal automatically. 
; However, when the phase offset parameter of the improper dihedral is 0, the corresponding potential term is an 
; even function of the dihedral angle, thus the permutation A-B-C-D -> A-C-B-D gives the same potential energy. 
; The CHARMM engine seemingly does this automatically, e.g. in the residue SAH (in CGenFF), but GROMACS does
; not support this. In order to satisfy grompp, we generate the corresponding dihedral types here.
